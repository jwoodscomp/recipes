# Description

This is a learning/test application for Rails.  This is still under improvement as I continue to learn more and experiment with more gems.  Currently the images are being pulled from Gravatar for the users and the recipe images are being uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket.

# Deployment

This application is deployed to Heroku for purposes of viewing.  This is using a completely free Heroku account, so the application may not always be available due to the limitations of a free account.

# Usage

Feel free to create users and recipes, rate recipes, and test out the functionality.  Admittedly the application isn't the prettiest, but this is for me to experiment with and become more comfortable with Rails.  When I have the time, I will probably go through the CSS and customize the layout and color scheme to be more friendly.
